# Big O notation
| Notation | Name | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O(1) | Constant | Determining if a binary number is even or odd; Calculating {\displaystyle (-1)^{n}}(-1)^{n}; Using a constant-size lookup table | 
| O(log log n)| Double logarithmic | Number of comparisons spent finding an item using interpolation search in a sorted array of uniformly distributed values |
| O(log n)| Logarithmic | Finding an item in a sorted array with a binary search or a balanced search tree as well as all operations in a Binomial heap |
| O(n)| Linear | Finding an item in an unsorted list or in an unsorted array; adding two n-bit integers by ripple carry|
| O(n log n) === O(log n!)| Linearithmic, loglinear, quasilinear, or "n logâ€‰n" | Performing a fast Fourier transform; Fastest possible comparison sort; heapsort and merge sort|
| O(n^2)| Quadratic | Multiplying two n-digit numbers by a simple algorithm; simple sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort; (worst case) bound on some usually faster sorting algorithms such as quicksort, Shellsort, and tree sort |
| O(n!)| Factorial | Solving the travelling salesman problem via brute-force search; generating all unrestricted permutations of a poset; finding the determinant with Laplace expansion; enumerating all partitions of a set |
